# Blueprint

Plutus Contract Blueprint, as introduced by [CIP-57](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0057) is an effective way of communicating desired structure of validator's associated types such as datum and redeemer to your off-chain code.

With Atlas, you can easily have these types generated for you based on provided schema, along with useful helper utilities!

<Callout>

If your validator is parameterised, parameters must be "data" encoded (instead of scott or sums-of-products encoding[^1]) as blueprint notation requires it (data) to be primary binary interface. This is not an issue for datums & redeemers as they are required to be data encoded anyway.

Validators written by tools such as Aiken use data encoding for validator parameters.

[Here](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas/blob/main/tests/aiken/bar/validators/baz.ak) we have a parameterised Aiken validator. Mainly, it checks that sum of integers and length of bytestrings given in parameters, datum & redeemer sum up to a specific value.

For this validator, we have a simple off-chain code [here](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas/blob/main/tests-privnet/GeniusYield/Test/Privnet/Blueprint.hs), have a look at it and we provide some description for it below.

We first use Template Haskell to splice declarations from [`makeBPTypes`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-Blueprint-TH.html#v:makeBPTypes) and [`uponBPTypes`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-Blueprint-TH.html#v:uponBPTypes). `makeBPTypes` introduces types from definitions given in blueprint file and `uponBPTypes` creates data related instances such as [`ToData`](https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddock/latest/plutus-ledger-api/PlutusLedgerApi-Common.html#t:ToData), [`FromData`](https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddock/latest/plutus-ledger-api/PlutusLedgerApi-Common.html#t:FromData) for these types[^2].

It is useful to see generated Template Haskell code to know for type and provided utility names which can be done via `-ddump-splices` GHC flag. You may combine this with `-ddump-to-file` to save the output to a file. If you are using cabal, see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24717500/viewing-core-when-compiling-with-cabal/69678961#69678961) answer on where one can find dumped splice files.

Now we can apply parameters (whose types have been generated by Atlas) to our validator with provided `applyParamsToBPValidator_baz_baz_spend` function and obtain `GYScript` from it using `scriptFromBPSerialisedScript` function. Likewise we have types generated for our datum & redeemer, sweet!

Rest of the off-chain code just tries to interact with the validator by creating a UTxO towards it and then later consuming from it.

<Callout>

To interact with blueprint file, you'll usually just need to import [`GeniusYield.Types.Blueprint.TH`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-Blueprint-TH.html) module (which is exposed by `GeniusYield.Types` module), however if you want to inspect the parsed blueprint file, you can use [`readBlueprint`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-Blueprint.html#v:readBlueprint).

[^2]: We could achieve both in single splice, however, since we are using utilities from PlutusTx to derive `ToData` etc. instances, they require type to be in scope first.
