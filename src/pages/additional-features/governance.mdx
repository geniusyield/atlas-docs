# Governance procedures

Atlas has support for facilitating proposal & voting procedures. Test [`GeniusYield.Test.Privnet.Gov`](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas/blob/main/tests-privnet/GeniusYield/Test/Privnet/Gov.hs) illustrates how to make a proposal and then how to vote on it. Governance related types are defined in [`GeniusYield.Types.Governance`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-Governance.html) module.
