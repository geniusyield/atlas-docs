# Provide `MonadIO` instances of query/builder monadic interpreters

Out of the box, we don't provide `MonadIO` instances for these interpreters as we don't want to allow arbitrary IO action within them. But it can be easily defined like so:

```haskell
import GeniusYield.TxBuilder.IO.Unsafe (unsafeIOToQueryMonad, unsafeIOToTxBuilderMonad)

instance MonadIO GYTxQueryMonadIO where
    liftIO = unsafeIOToQueryMonad

instance MonadIO GYTxBuilderMonadIO where
    liftIO = unsafeIOToTxBuilderMonad
```
