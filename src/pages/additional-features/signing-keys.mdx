`GYSigningKey` types encapsulates (normal - i.e., non-extended) signing keys whereas `GYExtendedSigningKey` encapsulates extended signing keys.

`generateSigningKey`, `writeSigningKey` and `readSigningKey` are used respectively, to generate, write & read a signing key. Likewise their are variants for extended signing key.

Corresponding verification key can be obtained from `getVerificationKey` for normal signing keys and via `getExtendedVerificationKey` for extended signing keys.

Likewise `verificationKeyHash` and `extendedVerificationKeyHash` gives us hash of the corresponding verification key.
