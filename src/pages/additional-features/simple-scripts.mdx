# Simple Scripts

Atlas supports simple scripts, aka native and timelock scripts. The functionality of simple scripts is explained in ledger design document of Shelley & Mary era [here](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger) and also in [cardano-node-wiki](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/reference/simple-scripts.md).

Simple scripts can be specified via exposed constructors of [`GYSimpleScript`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-Script-SimpleScript.html#t:GYSimpleScript). They can also be read from their JSON representation as `GYSimpleScript` has a [`FromJSON`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-2.2.3.0/docs/Data-Aeson.html#t:FromJSON) instance, we also provide a utility function, [`readSimpleScript`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-Script-SimpleScript.html#v:readSimpleScript), to read JSON representation from a file.

Simple scripts can also be attached to UTxO outputs to be used as reference script inputs later when building transaction. We have an example [here](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas/blob/main/tests-privnet/GeniusYield/Test/Privnet/SimpleScripts.hs), demonstrating interaction with simple scripts in both scenarios, when being used as reference and otherwise.
