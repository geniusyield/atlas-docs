# Browser Integration

Now that we have our server running, we need front-end UI to interact with it.

For all of the operations, the approach (_as previously mentioned_) is same which is to first get the unsigned transaction from server, sign it in browser and then submit the signed transaction either directly from wallet or from server's submit endpoint.

So essentially, we only have signing operation happening outside of our server-side code and operating in browser. To perform it, we make use of [Cardano Multiplatform Lib](https://github.com/dcSpark/cardano-multiplatform-lib) and is a boilerplate for all of our operations.

The entire code pertaining to browser operations is available [here](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas-docs/tree/main/src/components/browser-integration.tsx).

```typescript
const signTx = async (api: WalletApi, txCborHex: string): Promise<string> => {

  console.log('Unsigned transaction CBOR hex is ' + txCborHex);

  // Parse the base tx into the serialization lib model.
  const transaction = C.Transaction.from_bytes(fromHex(txCborHex));
  const txWitnessses = transaction.witness_set();
  const txVKeyWitnesses = txWitnessses.vkeys() ?? C.Vkeywitnesses.new();

  // Get the user to sign the base tx in the browser via wallet.
  const signedWitnessSet = C.TransactionWitnessSet.from_bytes(
    fromHex(await api.signTx(toHex(transaction.to_bytes()), true))
  );

  // Extract the vkey witnesses from the signing witness.
  const walletVkeyWitnesses = signedWitnessSet.vkeys(); // This won't actually be nullish (CIP 30).

  // Combine the wallet vkey witnesses with any existing vkey witnesses.
  for (let i = 0; i < walletVkeyWitnesses?.len() ?? 0; i++) {
    txVKeyWitnesses.add(walletVkeyWitnesses.get(i));
  }

  // Overwrite the vkeys in the tx witnesses.
  txWitnessses.set_vkeys(txVKeyWitnesses);

  // Compose the final tx.
  const finalTx = C.Transaction.new(transaction.body(), txWitnessses, transaction.auxiliary_data());

  // Convert to cbor hex. You can submit this in the browser with `api.submitTx()` or using the submit endpoint at backend.
  const finalTxCbor = toHex(finalTx.to_bytes());
  console.log('Final transaction CBOR is ' + finalTxCbor);
  return finalTxCbor;
}
```

Where the `api` above was simply obtained from browser like so `const api: WalletApi = await window.cardano[selectedWallet].enable();{:ts}`. Creating a type such as `WalletApi` was entirely optional.

An outline of this whole process is given below (actual `body` construction for this illustrative `add-ref-script` request can be seen in the given code):

```typescript
const {data} = await axios.post('http://localhost:8081/betref/add-ref-script', body)
const finalTxCbor = await signTx(api, data.urspTxBodyHex)
// txHash = await wallet.submitTx(finalTxCbor);  // alternate
const {data: submitData} = await axios.post('http://localhost:8081/tx/submit', finalTxCbor, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'  // was inferred in previous `post`
  }
})
console.log(submitData)
```

What follows is the demo for all of the operations we defined.
