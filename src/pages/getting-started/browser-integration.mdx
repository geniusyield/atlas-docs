# Browser Integration

Now that we have our server running, we need front-end UI to interact with it.

For all of the operations, the approach (_as previously mentioned_) is same which is to first get the unsigned transaction from server, use browser wallet's `signTx` method to get spending key witness for this transaction, and then use server's endpoint to add witness to this transaction & submit it.

The entire code pertaining to browser operations is available [here](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas-docs/tree/main/src/components/browser-integration.tsx).
</Callout>

An outline of this whole process is given below, illustrated via `add-ref-script` endpoint:

```typescript
// Obtain access to browser wallet api
const api: WalletApi = await window.cardano[selectedWallet].enable();  // Creating a type such as `WalletApi` was entirely optional.

// Create request body for calling our endpoint
const body = {
  arsUsedAddrs: await api.getUsedAddresses(),
  arsChangeAddr: await api.getChangeAddress(),
  arsCollateral: (await api.experimental.getCollateral())[0],
  arsPutAddress: convertAddrToRaw(values.putAddress),  // implementation detail
  arsBetParams: processBrpParams(brpParams),  // implementation detail
};

// Call endpoint
const { data } = await axios.post("http://localhost:8081/betref/add-ref-script", body);

// Sign & submit
const { data: submitData } = await axios.post(
  "http://localhost:8081/tx/add-wit-and-submit",
  { 
    awasTxUnsigned: data.urspTxBodyHex,
    awasTxWit: await api.signTx(data.urspTxBodyHex, true)  // Note that this second argument (corresponding to "partial signing") needs to be `true` as for inputs such as those belonging to script already have their witness and we need to give witness only for inputs belonging to us.
  },
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  }
);
```

What follows is the demo for all of the operations we defined.
