# Creating Endpoints

Now that we are confident with our smart contract, it's time that we make it accessible to end user.

The approach here would be 

1. Front-end asks to construct transaction for the concerned operation.
2. It then receives this transaction, which is complete besides missing for signature for spending inputs belonging to browser wallet. It calls wallet api's `signTx` method upon this body to get this signature (key witness).
3. Frontend now passes this unsigned transaction along with the witness it received to our backend endpoint which will add this witness to the transaction, making it complete and would then submit it.

We'll use [Servant](https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/) to create our endpoints and one may understand it by following their easy to understand tutorial [here](https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/tutorial/index.html).

<Callout>
Do note that we can also sign the transactions in server using the `signTx` function defined in [`GeniusYield.Types.TxBody`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-TxBody.html) module.
</Callout>

## Providing Data Provider

### Defining Provider Configuration

As noted earlier, building transaction bodies require gathering suitable information from the blockchain. For this purpose, we'll require a provider. Atlas is unopinionated and allows user to plug in provider of their choice, including a locally hosted one.

Currently Atlas supports the following providers (& it would be highly appreciated if community enriches this by contributing to [Atlas](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas/tree/main)):

* [Maestro](https://www.gomaestro.org/).
* Locally ran node along with [Kupo](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/). We have tested with version 8.1.2 of `cardano-node` and 2.7.2 of Kupo.
* [Blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io/).

<Callout type="warning">
  Following API functions don't have an optimal implementation for Blockfrost:

  * `utxosAtTxOutRefs`
  * `utxosAtTxOutRefsWithDatums`
  * `utxosAtAddressWithDatums`
  * `utxosAtAddresses`
  * `utxosAtAddressesWithDatums`
  * `utxosAtPaymentCredentialWithDatums`
  * `utxosAtPaymentCredentials`
  * `utxosAtPaymentCredentialsWithDatums`

  In general, we recommend either Maestro or local node with Kupo as provider.
</Callout>



To provide information about the provider, we will create a `config.json` file whose contents could be as follows:

<Callout>
  We have given a sample `config.json` file [here](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas-examples/tree/main/bet-ref/config.sample.json).
</Callout>

```json
{
  "coreProvider": ...,
  "networkId": "preprod",
  "logging": [{ "type": { "tag": "stderr" }, "severity": "Debug", "verbosity": "V2" }],
  "logTiming": false
}
```

where `coreProvider` field can have one of following possible values:

<Tabs items={['Maestro', 'Local Node with Kupo', 'Blockfrost']}>
  <Tab>
    ```json
    "coreProvider": { "maestroToken": "<Your-API-Key>", "turboSubmit": false },
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```json
    "coreProvider": { "socketPath": "path-to-node-socket", "kupoUrl": "http://localhost:1442" },
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```json
    "coreProvider": { "blockfrostKey": "<Your-API-Key>" },
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Here is the explanation for each of the JSON keys above:

* **`coreProvider`**: This field is the differentiating factor between different providers.
  * For Maestro, `maestroToken` holds the api key and `turboSubmit` field dictates whether the transactions are to be submitted via their [turbo submit](https://docs.gomaestro.org/Cardano/Transaction-Manager/tx-manager-turbo-submit) endpoint.
  * For Local Node with Kupo provider, `socketPath` is the path towards node socket (usually named `node.socket`) file and `kupoUrl` is the url where endpoints are made available by Kupo, it is usually `http://localhost:1442`.
  * For Blockfrost, `blockfrostKey` holds the required api key.
* **`networkId`**: Specifies your network and must be one of `mainnet`, `preprod`, `preview`, `testnet` (for legacy testnet) & `privnet` (for local private network).
* **`logging`**: It's a list of [scribes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/katip-0.8.7.3/docs/Katip.html#t:Scribe) to register. Its parameters (like `severity`, `verbosity`) and its general usage can be understood by going over their official haddock documentation [here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/katip-0.8.7.2/docs/Katip.html). Katip is also explained in [this](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-3739-7) book on web development in Haskell. Please have a look at haddock for `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` instances of [`GYLogScriptType`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-Logging.html#t:GYLogScribeType) to see sample usage.
* **`logTiming`**: (Optional) If set to `true`, operations involving provider are timed and corresponding durations are logged.

### Parsing Given Configuration

The file [`server-main.hs`](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas-examples/tree/main/bet-ref/server/server-main.hs) fires up our server. It reads & parses the configuration file and using it makes our endpoints (which we will define shortly) available. Here is its entire code.

```haskell showLineNumbers {1-7, 14-19}
-- | Getting path for our core configuration.
parseArgs :: IO FilePath
parseArgs = do
  args <- getArgs
  case args of
    coreCfg: _ -> return coreCfg
    _invalidArgument -> fail "Error: wrong arguments, needed a path to the CoreConfig JSON configuration file\n"

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn "Writing Swagger file ..."
  BL8.writeFile "swagger-api.json" (encodePretty apiSwagger)

  putStrLn "parsing Config ..."
  coreCfgPath <- parseArgs
  coreCfg <- coreConfigIO coreCfgPath  -- Parsing our core configuration.

  putStrLn "Loading Providers ..."
  withCfgProviders coreCfg "api-server"  $ \providers -> do
    let port = 8081
        ctx = Ctx coreCfg providers
    putStrLn $ "Starting server at \n " <> "http://localhost:" <> show port
    run port $ app ctx


app :: Ctx -> Application
app ctx = cors (const $ Just simpleCorsResourcePolicy { corsRequestHeaders = [HttpTypes.hContentType] }) $ serve appApi $ hoistServer appApi (Handler . ExceptT . try)  $ apiServer ctx
```

Focussing on the highlighted lines, you can see that it first reads the path to the configuration file (you would for instance run this file like so `cabal run betref-server -- config.json`) in line `coreCfgPath <- parseArgs{:haskell}`, then it parses this file `coreCfg <- coreConfigIO coreCfgPath{:haskell}`.

We then see the use of an interesting function `withCfgProviders`. It's type is `withCfgProviders :: GYCoreConfig  -> GYLogNamespace -> (GYProviders -> IO a) -> IO a{:haskell}`, thus, this function first takes our parsed configuration file, then a namespace, finally followed by a continuation `GYProviders -> IO a`. Idea here is that this function will setup a `GYProviders` from the parsed configuration file and send it to this continuation to obtain its result.

## Defining Endpoints

### Shared Context

<Callout type="warning" emoji="📃">
Entire code for it is available [here](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas-examples/tree/main/bet-ref/server-lib/BetRef/Api/Context.hs)
</Callout>

Our endpoints would need an information for our provider, thus we have created the type for it, called `Ctx`. It's usage is made clear by function defined next, `runQuery` which in essence correspond to `ctxRunC` we saw in section on [Integration Tests](./integration-tests.mdx). Reasoning for `runTxI` & `runTxF` follows similarly.

Note about our handling of collateral: Browser wallets usually have the option to set for collateral, in such a case wallets would create an UTxO specifically to be used as collateral and such an UTxO will be reserved, i.e., wallet won't be spending it. [CIP 40](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip40/) changed the properties related to collateral and therefore we can safely take even that UTxO as collateral which has large amounts of ada and it could also contain multiple assets. Therefore if there is no collateral set by browser wallet, framework is capable of choosing suitable UTxO as collateral (and also sets for return collateral & total collateral fields appropriately) and in that case it is also free to spend it, if required by transaction builder. But if however there is a 5-ada collateral set by wallet, then framework would use it as collateral and would also reserve it, i.e., it won't pick to spend it unless explicitly mentioned by transaction skeleton. Also note that, we'll use browser wallet's `getCollateral()` method to get for collateral. This method usually returns a list of ada-only UTxOs in wallet within a specific range (like in case of Nami, it is those with ada less than or equal to 50). We would send first element of this list (if exists) to backend and framework would check if the value contained in this UTxO is exactly 5 ada or not (like Nami's `getCollateral` method returns only a singleton list if collateral is set in wallet), if not, framework would ignore this (i.e., would not reserve for it) and would itself pick suitable UTxO as collateral. If however you want this to be reserved (& of course used as collateral) regardless of it's value, see the comment in call to `runGYTxMonadNodeF` in `runTxF` function.

```haskell
-- | Our Context.
data Ctx = Ctx
  { ctxCoreCfg   :: !GYCoreConfig
  , ctxProviders :: !GYProviders
  }

-- | To run for simple queries, the one which don't requiring building for transaction skeleton.
runQuery :: Ctx -> GYTxQueryMonadNode a -> IO a
runQuery ctx q = do
  let nid       = cfgNetworkId $ ctxCoreCfg ctx
      providers = ctxProviders ctx
  runGYTxQueryMonadNode nid providers q

-- | Wraps our skeleton under `Identity` and calls `runTxF`.
runTxI :: Ctx
       -> [GYAddress]           -- ^ User's used addresses.
       -> GYAddress             -- ^ User's change address.
       -> Maybe GYTxOutRefCbor  -- ^ Browser wallet's reserved collateral (if set).
       -> GYTxMonadNode (GYTxSkeleton v)
       -> IO GYTxBody
runTxI = coerce (runTxF @Identity)

-- | Tries to build for given skeletons wrapped under traversable structure.
runTxF :: Traversable t
       => Ctx
       -> [GYAddress]           -- ^ User's used addresses.
       -> GYAddress             -- ^ User's change address.
       -> Maybe GYTxOutRefCbor  -- ^ Browser wallet's reserved collateral (if set).
       -> GYTxMonadNode (t (GYTxSkeleton v))
       -> IO (t GYTxBody)
runTxF ctx addrs addr collateral skeleton  = do
  let nid       = cfgNetworkId $ ctxCoreCfg ctx
      providers = ctxProviders ctx
  runGYTxMonadNodeF GYRandomImproveMultiAsset nid providers addrs addr
    (collateral >>=
      (\c -> Just (getTxOutRefHex c,
                   True  -- Make this as `False` to not do 5-ada-only check for value in this given UTxO to be used as collateral.
                  )
      )
    ) skeleton
```

## Submit Endpoint

</Callout>

We'll soon see endpoints which will return for unsigned transaction to the browser but assuming that we already have a unsigned transaction CBOR & the missing signature, let's see how we can define an endpoint which will add this missing key witness to the transaction body and would then submit it using our provider.

Input to this endpoint is a type `AddWitAndSubmitParams` encapsulating our unsigned transaction body & missing key witness.

Then we have our function `handleAddWitAndSubmitTx` which adds the witness to the transaction making it complete and then it submits it. The response generated here is of type `SubmitTxResponse` and you can modify the same to include other fields if required.

```haskell
-- | Return type of API when submitting a transaction.
data SubmitTxResponse = SubmitTxResponse
                          { submitTxFee :: !Integer
                          , submitTxId  :: !GYTxId
                          } deriving (Show, Generic, ToJSON, Swagger.ToSchema)

-- | Input parameters to add for reference script.
data AddWitAndSubmitParams = AddWitAndSubmitParams
  { awasTxUnsigned :: !GYTx
  , awasTxWit      :: !GYTxWitness
  } deriving (Generic, FromJSON, Swagger.ToSchema)

-- | Construct `SubmitTxResponse` return type from the given signed transaction body.
txBodySubmitTxResponse :: GYTxBody -> SubmitTxResponse
txBodySubmitTxResponse txBody = SubmitTxResponse
                                  { submitTxFee = txBodyFee txBody
                                  , submitTxId  = txBodyTxId txBody
                                  }

-- | Type for our Servant API.
type TxAPI =
      "add-wit-and-submit"
    :> ReqBody '[JSON] AddWitAndSubmitParams
    :> Post '[JSON] SubmitTxResponse

-- | Serving our API.
handleTx :: Ctx -> ServerT TxAPI IO
handleTx = handleAddWitAndSubmitTx

-- | Handle for adding key witness to the unsigned transaction & then submit it.
handleAddWitAndSubmitTx :: Ctx -> AddWitAndSubmitParams -> IO SubmitTxResponse
handleAddWitAndSubmitTx ctx AddWitAndSubmitParams{..} = do
  let txBody = getTxBody awasTxUnsigned
  void $ gySubmitTx (ctxProviders ctx) $ makeSignedTransaction awasTxWit txBody
  return $ txBodySubmitTxResponse txBody
```

### Transaction Building Endpoints

Entire code for it is available [here](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas-examples/tree/main/bet-ref/server-lib/BetRef/Api/BetRef.hs)
</Callout>

At this point, it should be easy to follow the code here. We first define the input type for our endpoint, we also derive its `FromJSON` instance so that we can parse it from JSON that our front-end will send for it and we also derive its `Swagger.ToSchema` instance so as to document our endpoint. Then our endpoint calls the relevant operation which we defined before to get transactoin skeleton, using which we obtain the transaction body with the help of functions such as `runTxI` and return the result (wrapped in our `UnsignedTxResponse` type).

<Callout>
  You can see that all of our endpoints here ask for a list of used addresses, this makes them compatible with wallets that are not in single address mode (by default) such as [Eternl](https://eternl.io/).

### Wrap-Up

Our both the endpoints file (transaction submition & transaction building) our wrapped up in our [`Api.hs`](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas-examples/tree/main/bet-ref/server-lib/BetRef/Api/Api.hs) following the usual servant boilerplate.

```haskell
-- | Type for our Servant API.
type Api =
        "tx"  :> TxAPI
  :<|>  "betref" :>  BetRefApi

appApi :: Proxy Api
appApi = Proxy

apiSwagger  :: Swagger
apiSwagger  = toSwagger appApi

apiServer :: Ctx -> ServerT Api IO
apiServer ctx =
       handleTx ctx
  :<|> handleBetRefApi ctx
```

Now coming back to our [`server-main.hs`](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas-examples/tree/main/bet-ref/server/server-main.hs) file, we can now understand the highlighted code sections which relates to obtaining the Swagger file (generated from `apiSwagger` function above) and running up our servant server.

<Callout>
We follow `simpleCorsResourcePolicy` (also allowing `Content-Type` request header) so that calls by our front-end (which runs on different origin) don't get blocked.
</Callout>

```haskell showLineNumbers {11-12, 20-27}
-- | Getting path for our core configuration.
parseArgs :: IO FilePath
parseArgs = do
  args <- getArgs
  case args of
    coreCfg: _ -> return coreCfg
    _invalidArgument -> fail "Error: wrong arguments, needed a path to the CoreConfig JSON configuration file\n"

  putStrLn "Writing Swagger file ..."
  BL8.writeFile "swagger-api.json" (encodePretty apiSwagger)

        ctx = Ctx coreCfg providers
    putStrLn $ "Starting server at \n " <> "http://localhost:" <> show port
    run port $ app ctx


app :: Ctx -> Application
app ctx = cors (const $ Just simpleCorsResourcePolicy { corsRequestHeaders = [HttpTypes.hContentType] }) $ serve appApi $ hoistServer appApi (Handler . ExceptT . try)  $ apiServer ctx
```

Next we'll see how to call these endpoints in our front-end!
