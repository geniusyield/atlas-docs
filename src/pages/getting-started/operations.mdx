# Operations over Contract

Having understood the contract. Now is the time we actually start using our framework to build the transactions for it.

The main principle to understand here is that - we only need to give the essentials, i.e. we only specify what we _want_ and it is the job of the framework to do the rest.

For instance, we may tell that we want to consume a specific input belonging to the script's address and generate a specific output. Given that, it becomes framework's job to do the rest, say:

* Select available UTxO's in user's wallet and generate suitable change output to balance the transaction, considering fees.
* Make sure all generated UTxO's satisfy minimum ada requirement.
* Handle collateral.
* etc, etc.

Thus, we only specify at high-level what we want. This would become clear as we actually start writing operations for our contract.

Entire code for these operations is available [here](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas-examples/tree/main/bet-ref/server-lib/BetRef/Api/Operations.hs).

<Callout type="info">
  When working with Atlas inside your project, since Atlas isn't on Hackage, you'll need to [specify](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cabal-project.html#specifying-packages-from-remote-version-control-locations) it as a remote package inside your `cabal.project`. Moreover, since Atlas itself relies on dependencies which are outside Hackage, those would need to be specified too. To streamline this, it's best to use the [`cabal.project`](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas-examples/blob/main/cabal.project) mentioned in `atlas-examples` repository where you would just need to modify `packages:` stanza depending upon your project.

## Operation _1_: Generating address for our Smart Contract

### Generating Validator for our Smart Contract

Following the usual drill, we generate the Validator given contract parameters (following is written in file [`Compiled.hs`](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas-examples/tree/main/bet-ref/onchain/BetRef/OnChain/BetRef/Compiled.hs)):

```haskell filename="Compiled.hs"
-- | Generates validator given params.
betRefValidator :: BetRefParams -> PlutusTx.CompiledCode (PlutusTx.BuiltinData -> PlutusTx.BuiltinData -> PlutusTx.BuiltinData -> ())
betRefValidator betRefParams =
    $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| mkBetRefValidator||]) `PlutusTx.unsafeApplyCode` PlutusTx.liftCode plcVersion100 betRefParams
```

Inside Atlas, Plutus scripts are represented as [`GYScript (v :: PlutusVersion)`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-Script.html#t:GYScript).
The mentioned [`GeniusYield.Types.Script`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-Script.html) module contains a lot of helper utilities such as `scriptFromPlutus` which takes in Plutus's `PlutusTx.CompiledCode a` type to give out `GYScript v` where type variable `v` is of _kind_ `PlutusVersion` which is defined in [`GeniusYield.Types.PlutusVersion`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-Types-PlutusVersion.html) module and is used to tag plutus ledger version of our validator script[^1].

If we look at the type signature of `scriptFromPlutus`, we see: `scriptFromPlutus :: forall v a. SingPlutusVersionI v => PlutusTx.CompiledCode a -> GYScript v` where for the time being we can ignore the description of the typeclass `SingPlutusVersionI`[^1] besides noting the fact that only types (currently `'PlutusV1`, `'PlutusV2` & `'PlutusV3`) of kind `PlutusVersion` have an instance for it. So here, our function `scriptFromPlutus` works for all type variable `v` which have an instance of `SingPlutusVersionI` but there is no way to learn what this `v` is based solely on the input `PlutusTx.CompiledCode a` and therefore, caller must specify it, either by providing type signature (of callee or caller due to type inference) or by using [visible type application](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/type_applications.html). Our first operation does make use of it but before looking at it, we need to understand about `GYTxQueryMonad`.

### Interlude - `GYTxQueryMonad`

When we want to obtain the address of the script from its hash, besides the hash, we also need to know the network we are currently operating at. Is it some testnet or mainnet?

Similarly, transaction building involves querying the ledger for various information like say querying UTxO's present at one's address, similarly it might need help of some chain indexer to query datum in case output contains only the datum's hash.

All of this is captured by typeclass `GYTxQueryMonad` documented [here](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#t:GYTxQueryMonad). It is strongly advised to see methods made available by it.

So, if we are working inside a monad which happens to also provide an instance for it, we would happily be able to query such an information.

### Generating address

In this operation, we only need to obtain network details with the help of this monad. Here is the code to obtain address (notice that we have provided multiple versions of the same code here):

<Callout type="info">
  Type of [`scriptAddress`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#v:scriptAddress) used below is `scriptAddress :: forall (m :: * -> *) (v :: PlutusVersion). GYTxQueryMonad m => GYScript v -> m GYAddress`. Thus with respect to type application, the first parameter is for monad and second one is `PlutusVersion` kinded.

  Internally this function queries for network details.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['A', 'B', 'C']}>
  <Tab>
    ```haskell
    -- A. Type is given by `scriptAddress`.

    -- | Validator in question, obtained after giving required parameters.
    betRefValidator' ::  SingPlutusVersionI v => BetRefParams -> GYScript v
    betRefValidator' brp = scriptFromPlutus $ betRefValidator brp

    -- | Address of the validator, given params.
    betRefAddress :: (HasCallStack, GYTxQueryMonad m) => BetRefParams -> m GYAddress
    betRefAddress brp = scriptAddress @_ @'PlutusV2 $ betRefValidator' brp
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```haskell
    -- B. Type is given by `scriptFromPlutus` using type application.

    -- | Validator in question, obtained after giving required parameters.
    betRefValidator' brp = scriptFromPlutus @'PlutusV2 $ betRefValidator brp

    -- | Address of the validator, given params.
    betRefAddress :: (HasCallStack, GYTxQueryMonad m) => BetRefParams -> m GYAddress
    betRefAddress brp = scriptAddress $ betRefValidator' brp
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```haskell
    -- C. Type is specified using signature.

    -- | Validator in question, obtained after giving required parameters.
    betRefValidator' :: BetRefParams -> GYScript 'PlutusV2
    betRefValidator' brp = scriptFromPlutus $ betRefValidator brp

    -- | Address of the validator, given params.
    betRefAddress :: (HasCallStack, GYTxQueryMonad m) => BetRefParams -> m GYAddress
    betRefAddress brp = scriptAddress $ betRefValidator' brp
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Well what is this monad `m` being used here? Well any! As long as it has an instance for `GYTxQueryMonad`. When we will start writing tests, then we'll use all of these operations and most likely how to use them would become clear then.

## Operation _2_: Adding Input to refer later (Reference Input)


### Interlude - `GYTxSkeleton`

As mentioned before, we just mention at high level what we want in a transaction. This is captured by [`GYTxSkeleton`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#t:GYTxSkeleton) datatype and its description is mentioned below.

In case this UTxO doesn't belong to a script, we just need spending key witness, otherwise we need the associated script, its datum and input redeemer where the associated script could be provided as part of this transaction body or could be obtained from reference input.

When constructing the transaction, we just need to specify what we want in this skeleton.

This skeleton naturally has a monoid instance where two skeletons are combined by running `mappend` over each of their fields. We have utility functions defined in the same ([`GeniusYield.TxBuilder.Class`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html)) module like:

```haskell
mustHaveOutput :: GYTxOut v -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustHaveOutput o = emptyGYTxSkeleton {gytxOuts = [o]}

mustHaveInput :: GYTxIn v -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustHaveInput i = emptyGYTxSkeleton {gytxIns = [i]}

mustHaveRefInput :: GYTxOutRef -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustHaveRefInput i = emptyGYTxSkeleton { gytxRefIns = GYTxSkeletonRefIns (Set.singleton i) }

mustMint :: GYBuildScript v -> GYRedeemer -> GYTokenName -> Integer -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustMint _ _ _ 0 = mempty
mustMint p r tn n = emptyGYTxSkeleton {gytxMint = Map.singleton p (Map.singleton tn n, r)}

mustBeSignedBy :: GYPubKeyHash -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustBeSignedBy pkh = emptyGYTxSkeleton {gytxSigs = Set.singleton pkh}

isInvalidBefore :: GYSlot -> GYTxSkeleton v
isInvalidBefore s = emptyGYTxSkeleton {gytxInvalidBefore = Just s}

isInvalidAfter :: GYSlot -> GYTxSkeleton v
isInvalidAfter s = emptyGYTxSkeleton {gytxInvalidAfter = Just s}

mustHaveTxMetadata :: Maybe GYTxMetadata -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustHaveTxMetadata m = emptyGYTxSkeleton {gytxMetadata = m}

mustHaveWithdrawal :: GYTxWdrl v -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustHaveWithdrawal w = mempty {gytxWdrls = [w]}

mustHaveCertificate :: GYTxCert v -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustHaveCertificate c = mempty {gytxCerts = [c]}

mustHaveVotingProcedures :: VersionIsGreaterOrEqual v 'PlutusV3 => GYTxVotingProcedures v -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustHaveVotingProcedures vp = emptyGYTxSkeleton {gytxVotingProcedures = GYTxSkeletonVotingProcedures vp}

mustHaveProposalProcedure :: VersionIsGreaterOrEqual v 'PlutusV3 => GYProposalProcedurePB -> GYTxBuildWitness v -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustHaveProposalProcedure pp w = mustHaveProposalProcedures [(pp, w)]

mustHaveProposalProcedures :: VersionIsGreaterOrEqual v 'PlutusV3 => [(GYProposalProcedurePB, GYTxBuildWitness v)] -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustHaveProposalProcedures pps = emptyGYTxSkeleton {gytxProposalProcedures = GYTxSkeletonProposalProcedures pps}

mustHaveDonation :: VersionIsGreaterOrEqual v 'PlutusV3 => Natural -> GYTxSkeleton v
mustHaveDonation n = emptyGYTxSkeleton {gytxDonation = GYTxSkeletonDonation n}
```

Thus we can specify that our transaction must have this output (using `mustHaveOutput`) and that output and must have this input (using `mustHaveInput`) and so on... and combine them all into a single skeleton using `mappend`.

### Skeleton for adding reference input

Here we want to create an output at a given address (Oracle's address) with the given datum. This UTxO is to be later used as a reference input by script where the script would refer to its datum. Here we have decided to keep this datum inline.

```haskell
-- | Add UTxO to be used as reference input at a given address with given datum.
addRefInput :: GYAddress -> OracleAnswerDatum -> GYTxSkeleton 'PlutusV2
addRefInput addr dat =
  mustHaveOutput $ GYTxOut addr mempty (Just (datumFromPlutusData dat, GYTxOutUseInlineDatum)) Nothing
  -- Note that the value can be empty as tx building logic would add the needed minimum UTxO ada.
```

Note that we have mentioned the value as empty for this UTxO and this is one of the beauties of our framework that it will itself manage adding lovelaces to satisfy minimum ada requirement.

### Q: Can you create a skeleton for adding reference script?

<details>
  <summary> Toggle Answer </summary>
  Given the output address `addr :: GYAddress{:haskell}` and the Plutus V2 validator `script :: GYScript 'PlutusV2{:haskell}`, we can write `mustHaveOutput $ GYTxOut addr mempty (Just (datumFromPlutusData (), GYTxOutDontUseInlineDatum)) (Just script){:haskell}`
</details>

## Operation _3_: Placing a bet

### Placing the first bet

In case this is a first bet (a program handling the bets can decide whether the bet being placed by the user is first or not by querying the UTxOs at the script address), then we just need to produce an output at the script address with the bet value and our guess.

```haskell
-- | Operation to place bet.
placeBet :: (HasCallStack, GYTxMonad m)
              => GYTxOutRef         -- ^ Reference Script.
              -> BetRefParams       -- ^ Validator Params.
              -> OracleAnswerDatum  -- ^ Guess.
              -> GYValue            -- ^ Bet amount to place.
              -> GYAddress          -- ^ Own address.
              -> Maybe GYTxOutRef   -- ^ Reference to previous bets UTxO (if any).
              -> m (GYTxSkeleton PlutusV2)
placeBet refScript brp guess bet ownAddr mPreviousBetsUtxoRef = do
  pkh <- addressToPubKeyHash' ownAddr
  betAddr <- betRefAddress brp
  case mPreviousBetsUtxoRef of
    -- This is the first bet.
    Nothing -> do
      return $ mustHaveOutput $ GYTxOut
        { gyTxOutAddress = betAddr
        , gyTxOutValue = bet
        , gyTxOutDatum = Just (datumFromPlutusData $ BetRefDatum [(pubKeyHashToPlutus pkh, guess)] (valueToPlutus bet), GYTxOutDontUseInlineDatum)
        , gyTxOutRefS    = Nothing
        }
```

At this point, it should be clear what is happening in the above code block. This function is somewhat overloaded and is handling both the cases whether the bet is first or not and it determines this using the presence of reference to a UTxO (representing previous bets) at validator script. In case there isn't one, i.e., `Nothing` for our `Maybe` value, we are placing the first bet. Notice that we mention that our datum shouldn't be inlined to output using `GYTxOutDontUseInlineDatum`.

### Placing subsequent bets

Here we would be exercising script's logic for the first time. We would be consuming the UTxO present at script address. We have defined a function, viz. `input` which would take in the following parameters:

* `BetRefParams`: to generate the validator script or else we can read the script from the UTxO pertaining to reference script.
* Reference to reference script UTxO.
* Reference of script input to consume.
* The datum present at this input. Recall that our datum was not inlined for this particular output, we therefore would need lookup the datum using `lookupDatum` to pass the actual datum to this function.
* Redeemer action.

Thus, we have its definition as:

```haskell
-- | Utility function to consume script UTxO.
input :: BetRefParams -> GYTxOutRef -> GYTxOutRef -> BetRefDatum -> BetRefAction -> GYTxSkeleton 'PlutusV3
input brp refScript inputRef dat red =
  mustHaveInput
    GYTxIn
      { gyTxInTxOutRef = inputRef
      , gyTxInWitness =
          GYTxInWitnessScript
            (GYBuildPlutusScriptReference refScript $ betRefValidator' brp)
            (datumFromPlutusData dat)
            (redeemerFromPlutusData red)
      }
```

<Callout type="info">
  In case we didn't want to use reference script, we would write `gyTxInWitness` as: 
  ```haskell
  gyTxInWitness  = GYTxInWitnessScript
          (GYBuildPlutusScriptInlined (betRefValidator' brp))
          (datumFromPlutusData dat)
          (redeemerFromPlutusData red)
  ```
</Callout>

Following is the complete code for handling this case. Few comments to facilitate its understanding:

* We first query the UTxO corresponding to previous bets at script address and we then query for its datum using `utxoDatum'` which tries its best to retrieve the datum and raises an exception in case it fails. This is its signature: `utxoDatum' :: (GYTxQueryMonad m, Plutus.FromData a) => GYUTxO -> m (GYAddress, GYValue, a)`.
  * _Note_: [`utxoAtTxOutRef'`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#v:utxoAtTxOutRef-39-) is a wrapper around [`utxoAtTxOutRef`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#v:utxoAtTxOutRef) which raises an exception in case the result was `Nothing`.

* We then see the use of `gyLogDebug'` which as you would expect is for logging purposes. The first argument that it takes correspond to namespace as used by [`Katip`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/katip-0.8.7.2/docs/Katip-Core.html#t:Namespace). This is where integration of off-chain and on-chain code really begins to shine ✨, having the `Show` instance defined for some of our on-chain types allows us to log them.

* `timeFromPlutus` is as you'll expect - gives us the framework's representation of time from that of plutus. And `enclosingSlotFromTime'` uses ledger's information to determine the corresponding slot for the given time. We need this as cardano's node work in slots. We mention that our transaction is to be invalid after this slot using `isInvalidAfter`.


* We mention that our transaction must have our public key hash as signatories when plutus smart contract asks for it using `mustBeSignedBy`.

* Lastly, this transaction must generate an output to the script's address with the updated datum and added value.
  * `valueToPlutus` gives the corresponding value type used by plutus from what we have in our framework (viz., `GYValue`).

All these skeletons are combined together using `mappend` defined for `GYTxSkeleton`.

```haskell
    -- Need to append to previous.
    Just previousBetsUtxoRef -> do
      previousUtxo <- utxoAtTxOutRef' previousBetsUtxoRef
      (_addr, previousValue, dat@(BetRefDatum previousGuesses _previousBet)) <- utxoDatum' previousUtxo
      gyLogDebug' "" $ printf "previous guesses %s" (show previousGuesses)
      betUntilSlot <- enclosingSlotFromTime' (timeFromPlutus $ brpBetUntil brp)
      gyLogDebug' "" $ printf "bet until slot %s" (show betUntilSlot)
      return $
           input brp refScript previousBetsUtxoRef dat (Bet guess)
        <> mustHaveOutput GYTxOut
              { gyTxOutAddress = betAddr
              , gyTxOutValue = bet <> previousValue
              , gyTxOutDatum = Just (datumFromPlutusData $ BetRefDatum ((pubKeyHashToPlutus pkh, guess) : previousGuesses) (valueToPlutus bet), GYTxOutDontUseInlineDatum)
              , gyTxOutRefS    = Nothing
              }
        <> isInvalidAfter betUntilSlot
        <> mustBeSignedBy pkh
```

## Operation _4_: Taking the bet pot

At this point, reading following code snippet should make sense as it is similar to what we have done before. Here note that we are using `mustHaveRefInput` to tell that the transaction must have the following UTxO reference as a reference input.

<Callout>
  Observe that we don't need to specify that the value we successfully consume from the script's UTxO must reach us because transaction balancer would add the change output to us.
</Callout>

```haskell
-- | Operation to take UTxO corresponding to previous bets.
takeBets :: (HasCallStack, GYTxMonad m)
              => GYTxOutRef    -- ^ Reference Script.
              -> BetRefParams  -- ^ Validator params.
              -> GYTxOutRef    -- ^ Script UTxO to consume.
              -> GYAddress     -- ^ Own address.
              -> GYTxOutRef    -- ^ Oracle reference input.
              -> m (GYTxSkeleton PlutusV2)
takeBets refScript brp previousBetsUtxoRef ownAddr oracleRefInput = do
  pkh <- addressToPubKeyHash' ownAddr
  previousUtxo <- utxoAtTxOutRef' previousBetsUtxoRef
  (_addr, _previousValue, dat) <- utxoDatum' previousUtxo
  betRevealSlot <- enclosingSlotFromTime' (timeFromPlutus $ brpBetReveal brp)
  return $
       input brp refScript previousBetsUtxoRef dat Take
    <> isInvalidBefore betRevealSlot
    <> mustHaveRefInput oracleRefInput
    <> mustBeSignedBy pkh
```

## Additional Useful Features

### `utxosDatums`

Sometimes we want to see all _valid_ UTxOs at our script address. In Cardano, anyone can form UTxO at any address and such a UTxO need not have valid datum as required by our script. `utxosDatums` can be used wither out invalid ones. See it's usage in [Vesting example](./../more-tutorials#vesting).

### `mustMint`

We weren't minting any tokens in our example here and thus didn't make use of `mustMint` skeleton function. It's sample usage is given in [this](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas/blob/main/src/GeniusYield/Api/TestTokens.hs) example. Which also illustrates how one can mint NFT and shows usage of `someUTxO` function which essentially gives some random UTxO belonging to wallet.

### Withdrawals, Stake Validator & Stake Certificates

We haven't made use of withdrawals, stake certificates and stake validators in our example. A sample illustration is provided in [this](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas/blob/main/tests-privnet/GeniusYield/Test/Privnet/Stake.hs) privnet test.

### Additional certificates

Atlas has rich support of all possible certificates, see our section on [Certificates](./../additional-features/certificates) to learn more about working with them.

### Governance procedures

See [Governance procedures](./../additional-features/governance) section to learn how to do governance procedures using Atlas.

### Treasury donation

As previously shown, our `GYTxSkeleton` supports for specifying treasury donation, see See "Donation" test in [`GeniusYield.Test.Privnet.Examples.Misc`](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas/blob/main/src/GeniusYield/Test/Privnet/Examples/Misc.hs) module for an example.

## Monad hierarchy

In Atlas we have hierarchy of monads with increasing level of capabilities. We already introduced `GYTxQueryMonad`. Besides it, we also have following monads. Don't worry if it appears overwhelming, they are mainly there for advanced usage and you would very rarely need to bother about their internals.

### [`GYTxUserQueryMonad`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#t:GYTxUserQueryMonad)

`GYTxQueryMonad` is a super-class of [`GYTxUserQueryMonad`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#t:GYTxUserQueryMonad). It is to be used for queries which have access to user's wallet details, such as change address, used addresses and so on. Please have a look at it's haddock entry [here](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#t:GYTxUserQueryMonad) to view available functions.

### [`GYTxBuilderMonad`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#t:GYTxBuilderMonad)

`GYTxUserQueryMonad` is a superclass of [`GYTxBuilderMonad`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#t:GYTxBuilderMonad). Purpose of `GYTxBuilderMonad` is to allow for functions related to transaction building. This however could have been part of `GYTxUserQueryMonad` but is separate only to allow for different custom transaction building strategy to be used as default. As we will soon see, in our code, we would use [`buildTxBody`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#v:buildTxBody) to build for transaction, and that would be possible only if we are working inside `GYTxBuilderMonad`.

### [`GYTxMonad`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#t:GYTxMonad)

`GYTxBuilderMonad` is a superclass of [`GYTxMonad`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#t:GYTxMonad). Difference between `GYTxMonad` and `GYTxBuilderMonad` is that former allows for signing of transactions, thus it requires access to user's private key. The main function we would encounter from this class is [`signAndSubmitConfirmed`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#v:signAndSubmitConfirmed).

### [`GYTxGameMonad`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#t:GYTxMonad)

`GYTxMonad` is a superclass of [`GYTxGameMonad`](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/GeniusYield-TxBuilder-Class.html#t:GYTxMonad). This monad allows for simulating multiple users, and is mainly used for testing. We touch more on it in our [testing](./testing) section.
