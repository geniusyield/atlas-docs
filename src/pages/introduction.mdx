# Introduction

Atlas is an all-in-one, Haskell-native application backend for writing off-chain code for on-chain Plutus smart contracts. Atlas has been designed by [Genius Yield](https://www.geniusyield.co/?lng=en), in collaboration with [MLabs](https://mlabs.city/), [Well-Typed](https://well-typed.com/) and [Plank](https://www.joinplank.com/).

## Features

### Easily build transactions
Use an intuitive API to abstract away the complexity around building transactions, balancing UTxOs, and interfacing with Plutus smart contracts.

### Leverage first-class Haskell
Write type-safe abstractions, harnessing the power & security of Haskell.

### Utilize modular data providers
Query ledger state information from remote provider such as [Maestro](https://www.gomaestro.org/dapp-platform), [Blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io/) or from your own node with the help of [Kupo](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/). You can also build and contribute your own data provider!

### Test extensively
Use Atlas' test harness to write realistic [test](./getting-started/testing) harness,
which can be run against either an emulator or a private Cardano network. Atlas offers a unified testing approach and the same test code can seamlessly execute on both an emulated mock ledger and an actual private Cardano test network.

### Stay up to date
Benefit from Cardano's latest innovations such as **Reference Inputs**, **Inline Datums**, **Reference Scripts**, governance actions and so on.
