# Introduction

Atlas is an all-in-one, Haskell-native application backend for writing off-chain code for on-chain Plutus smart contracts. Atlas has been designed by [Genius Yield](https://www.geniusyield.co/?lng=en), in collaboration with [MLabs](https://mlabs.city/), [Well-Typed](https://well-typed.com/) and [Plank](https://www.joinplank.com/).

## Features

### Easily build transactions
Use an intuitive API to abstract away the complexity around building transactions, balancing UTxOs, and interfacing with Plutus smart contracts.

### Leverage first-class Haskell
Avoid code duplication between on-chain and off-chain code, interoperate with advanced functionalities offered by IOG's Cardano/Plutus libraries, and easily convert between Atlas and Cardano/Plutus types.

### Utilize modular data providers
Query ledger state information from [Maestro](https://www.gomaestro.org/dapp-platform), a local node or [Cardano DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync). You can also build and contribute your own data provider!

### Test extensively
Use Atlas' test harness to write realistic [unit tests](./getting-started/unit-tests) that correspond to on-chain behavior, and execute [integration tests](./getting-started/integration-tests) against cardano node in a private network.

### Stay up to date
Benefit from Cardano's latest innovations such as **Reference Inputs**, **Inline Datums** and **Reference Scripts**.
